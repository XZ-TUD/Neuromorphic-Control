# Half-Center Oscillator (HCO) Model for Neuromorphic Pendulum Control

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of a **2-neuron Half-Center Oscillator (HCO)** model used to generate torque signals for pendulum control. The system is based on the neural control structure described in:

> Schmetterling, Raphael, et al. **Neuromorphic control of a pendulum.** , IEEE Control Systems Letters* (2024).

## üî¨ Overview

The model simulates two reciprocally inhibiting neurons with adaptive dynamics and nonlinear synaptic interactions. The membrane potentials of the neurons evolve via a system of ODEs, and a **thresholded membrane potential** of one neuron is used to generate **torque pulses** to control a pendulum.

The simulation illustrates:
- Membrane voltage oscillations (`v‚ÇÅ`, `v‚ÇÇ`)
- Torque generation based on `v‚ÇÅ`
- Influence of synaptic and adaptation time constants on behavior

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Features

- **Neural Model**:  
  Two neurons with:
  - Self-excitation
  - Mutual inhibition
  - Ultra-slow adaptive feedback
  - Sigmoidal synaptic dynamics

- **Torque Generation**:  
  A thresholded function of `v‚ÇÅ` outputs a square-wave-like torque.

- **Time-Dependent Modulation**:  
  Excitatory gain `a‚ÇÉ` changes after 3 seconds to transition the network behavior.

- **Inputs**:  
  External input to Neuron 1 changes between 0.3s‚Äì0.6s.

## üìä Output

- `v‚ÇÅ`, `v‚ÇÇ`: Membrane voltages  
- `torque`: Generated torque signal  
- `t`: Time vector  
- Output is saved to `single_HCO.mat`

## üß™ Parameters (Selected)

| Parameter | Description | Value |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| `tau_s` | Synaptic time constant | `0.05` s |
| `tau_us` | Ultra-slow adaptation time constant | `2.5` s |
| `a1`, `a2`, `a4` | Self and mutual excitation/inhibition | Tunable |
| `input_fn1` | Time-varying input to Neuron 1 | -1.2 (0.3s‚Äì0.6s) |
| `input_fn2` | Constant input to Neuron 2 | -1.0 |

To test variations, you can change `rate_idx` to select a different value of `a‚ÇÑ` (from a predefined list).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Code

In MATLAB:
```matlab
single_HCO

## üß© Other Code

- "Vary_tau_s.m ": Scripts with varied `tau_s` (synaptic time constant)
- "Vary_tau_us.m ": Scripts with varied `tau_us` (ultra-slow adaptation constant)

These two scripts explore how changes in synaptic and adaptation timescales affect the oscillatory behavior and torque generation of the HCO network. By tuning `tau_s` and `tau_us`, users can investigate network responsiveness, rhythm stability, and phase shifts‚Äîproviding insights into biologically inspired motor control and temporal processing.
